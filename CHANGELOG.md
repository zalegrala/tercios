# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`--span-attribute-padding`** CLI flag. Inflates every span in each OTLP export call
  with N bytes of pseudo-random printable-ASCII content as a `gen.padding` string
  attribute. Use to validate per-request payload size limits (e.g. an Envoy buffer
  filter). Padding is applied as the last pipeline stage, after chaos.
  See [docs/payload-testing.md](docs/payload-testing.md).

- **`--traces-per-batch`** CLI flag. Bundles N traces into each OTLP export call
  (default 1). Use to simulate a high-rate client or abusive batch sender without
  increasing concurrency. Composes with `--span-attribute-padding` to independently
  control trace count and per-span size within a single request.

## [v0.7.0] — 2026-05-13

This release adds the user-facing `--streaming` mode that v0.6.0's
`StreamingWalker` set up for. Streaming is implemented as a thin wrapper
around the OTLP exporter — the pipeline, scenario, and chaos layers are
unchanged. Eager mode behavior is identical to v0.6.0.

### Added

- **`--streaming` CLI flag** in `tercios`. When set, each batch is paced
  by span `EndTime` before being forwarded to the OTLP exporter, so
  backends that reject future timestamps (e.g. Tempo) accept long-running
  traces. See `docs/streaming.md` once it lands; for now, the flag's
  `-help` description and `examples/slow_scenario.json` are the entry
  points.
- **`internal/otlp.NewStreamingBatchExporter(inner)`** wraps any
  `model.BatchExporter` so that `ExportBatch` sleeps until each span's
  `EndTime` (grouped by identical end-times) before calling the inner
  exporter. Honors `ctx.Done()` mid-sleep; propagates inner errors.
- **`internal/otlp.NewStreamingExporterFactory(inner)`** wraps a
  `model.BatchExporterFactory` so every exporter it produces is paced.
  The CLI installs this when `--streaming` is set.
- **`examples/slow_scenario.json`** — a 5-second-per-trace scenario for
  watching streaming pace traces over visible wall-clock time.

### Behavior

- **Timestamps are rebased at export time.** When a paced trace sits in
  the producer→exporter channel before being pulled, its `EndTime`s are
  in the past relative to wall-clock now. The streaming exporter shifts
  every span by `(now - earliest StartTime)` before pacing, so each
  trace gets its full nominal duration regardless of queuing latency.
  Without this, streaming would silently degrade to eager for any trace
  the channel buffered.
- **`--export-timeout` semantics shift in streaming mode.** In eager
  mode the pipeline wraps each `ExportBatch` call in
  `context.WithTimeout(ctx, exportTimeout)`. In streaming mode that
  would kill a paced trace mid-flight, so the pipeline-level timeout is
  bypassed when `--streaming` is set. The OTLP SDK's own per-request
  timeout (also configured from `--export-timeout`) still applies to
  each inner request inside the streaming exporter.
- **`--exporters` becomes the in-flight cap in streaming mode.** Each
  exporter worker handles one paced trace at a time. To run N traces
  concurrently, set `--exporters=N`. To run streaming and eager traffic
  simultaneously, run two `tercios` processes side by side.
- **`add_latency` chaos is now compatible with streaming.** The chaos
  stage runs before the streaming exporter; the pacer reads the
  post-chaos `EndTime` and sleeps until then, so the no-future-timestamp
  guarantee holds even when chaos pushes end times later.

### Internal

- The streaming exporter is in `internal/otlp/`, not `internal/pipeline/`
  or `internal/scenario/`. The pipeline does not know streaming exists;
  the scenario package does not know either. All eager-mode tests are
  unchanged and pass.
- Nine unit tests in `streaming_exporter_test.go` cover: empty-batch
  no-op, `EndTime` ordering, grouping by identical `EndTime`, sleep
  until `EndTime`, rebase of stale timestamps, cancellation, inner
  error propagation, shutdown forwarding, factory wrapping.

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-05-13

This release unifies the eager and streaming trace generators behind a single
heap-driven walker. The eager `GenerateBatch` API is unchanged; internally
it now drains the same heap the future streaming exporter uses, with no
wall-clock pacing.

### Added

- **Public `StreamingWalker` + `NewStreamingWalker`** in `internal/scenario`.
  Drains a single trace one emit at a time; the caller controls pacing.
  Methods: `NextEmit`, `NextDueAt`, `Done`, `TraceID`.
- **`RunSingleTrace(ctx, walker, sink)`** helper that drives a walker to
  completion with wall-clock pacing (`time.NewTimer` per pop), respecting
  `ctx.Done()`. The minimal scheduling primitive a future streaming
  exporter will compose.
- **`pendingEmit` / `traceState` / `emitHeap` types** as the foundation
  shared by both modes. The heap orders by `(DueAt asc, IsRoot asc, Seq
  asc)` so the root sentinel always pops after coincident descendants.
- **`Generator.stepDuration(child)`**: scenario time one repeat of an
  edge consumes (`edge.Duration + subtreeDuration[edge.To] + 1ms`).
  Used to stagger sibling DueAts so the heap-pop order matches
  sequential DFS pre-order.

### Changed

- **Eager walker replaced** with the heap-driven walker. `emitFromNode`,
  `walkFrame`, and the cursor-restore sentinel are gone. `materializedChild`
  no longer carries `ChildrenStart` or `CursorAfter` — the heap walker
  derives those positions directly from `DueAt` and `subtreeDuration`.
- **Root span moves from first to last** in `GenerateBatch`'s returned
  slice. The trace is semantically identical (same span IDs, same
  parent/child links, same timestamps); only the order in the output
  blob differs. This matches real OTel SDK emission order, where parents
  call `Span.End()` after their children complete.

  **User-visible effect**: anything that read `batch[0]` and assumed it
  was the root needs to find the root by `ParentSpanID.IsValid() ==
  false`. The internal test helpers in this repo (`rootSpanName`) show
  the pattern.
- **Span ID allocation order unchanged** from v0.5.0: the root SpanID
  is still `idState.next()` first, then descendants in DFS pre-order.
  Only the emit order in the returned slice differs.

### Internal

- `walker` is the internal trace-emission engine; `GenerateBatch` calls
  `drain()`, `StreamingWalker` calls `popOne()`. One codebase, two
  pacing modes.
- Children of a pair edge with `network_latency_ms > 0` now correctly
  attach inside the (narrower) target-side span instead of starting
  before it. Caught by `TestPairEdgeLatencyChildrenFitInsideTarget`
  failing on a two-level latency scenario during the unification.

## [v0.5.0] — 2026-05-13

This release focuses on producing **realistic distributed-trace shapes**: spans
now properly contain their children in time, pair edges can model network
latency between client and server, and the scenario validator catches several
classes of silent misconfigurations.

### Added

- **`network_latency_ms` field on pair edges** (`client_server`,
  `producer_consumer`, `client_database`). When non-zero, the target-side
  span (server / consumer / database) is inset by `network_latency_ms` on both
  sides of the source-side span's interval — modeling request-travel and
  response-travel time. Defaults to `0` (preserves prior behavior). The
  default scenario now uses small realistic values (1ms HTTP, 2ms Postgres,
  1ms Kafka).
- **Reachability validation**: scenarios with nodes not reachable from `root`
  are rejected with the offending IDs named in the error. Previously these
  nodes were silently ignored.
- **Root-incoming-edge validation**: the node declared as `root` must not be
  the target of any edge. Previously the walker silently dropped the
  incoming edge and orphaned the parent.
- **Richer timing-validation errors**: when `2 * network_latency_ms >=
  duration_ms`, the error now reports the computed effective span duration,
  the subtree work under the target, and the resulting (infeasible) server
  interval.
- **`--export-timeout` CLI flag** forwarded to the OTLP SDK client.
- **`BenchmarkGenerateBatch`** for tracking per-trace generation cost.

### Changed

- **Span timestamps**: every parent span now temporally contains every
  descendant span (`parent.start ≤ child.start && child.end ≤ parent.end`).
  Intermediate spans previously ended at `start + edge.Duration` and their
  children began after the parent ended — a known oddity inherited from
  the original recursive walker. Span IDs, names, parent links, attributes,
  and root timing are unchanged.

  **User-visible effect**: any test asserting on exact intermediate-span
  timestamps will need updates. Golden output comparisons against pre-0.5.0
  span dumps will not match.

- **Iterative walker**: the scenario generator no longer uses Go-runtime
  recursion. The traversal is now an explicit stack of `walkFrame` entries.
  Output is structurally equivalent to before; the change is internal and
  unlocks the future streaming exporter without affecting the eager path.

### Internal refactors (no behavior change)

- `NextChildren` / `ChildSpec` expose the outgoing-edge lookup as a
  first-class operation on `Generator`.
- `materializeChild` / `materializePair` factor the per-edge-kind span
  construction out of `emitFromNode`. The three two-span edge kinds
  (`ClientServer`, `ProducerConsumer`, `ClientDatabase`) now share one
  helper parameterized by `SpanKind`.
- Iterative walker uses a cursor-restore sentinel on the stack so siblings
  of a just-drained parent start at the correct timestamp.
- Validation logic is unified behind `Config.Validate` with a shared
  outgoing-edges index reused by both DAG and timing checks.

### Performance

- `BenchmarkGenerateBatch` on the test scenario: ~5.5 µs per 9-span trace,
  62 allocations, 21 KB. Roughly 20% slower than v0.4.0's recursive walker
  due to the cursor-restore sentinel pushes; well below OTLP encoding and
  network costs in real workloads.

### Documentation

- README gained a Docker-image usage example (already shipped in v0.4.0 docs
  rev; included here for the unified history).
